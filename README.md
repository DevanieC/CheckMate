Mobile expense tracker app project still in development. Currently has firebase implemented.

This is a mobile app project I started for my Software Engineering I class. I decided to do an Expense Tracker because I felt it related to me personally and would be a great tool for not only me, but my friends and family to use as well. Over time I plan to add different features, such as better secutiry, user customization, multi-user use, and more.
